Todo for Modpack managment:
~Get the modpack JAR file, upload to Curse or modrinth, but make sure to swap all jar files and verify there not local files!
If there local mods, the Curse/Modrinth will deny the upload, Ofc this can happen normally but still needs to be checked

~When making an update, also make the next version and hook the html for it, this way its always on the newest version link OR set the HTML link to always go to the homepage, this will ensure no confusion over correction
