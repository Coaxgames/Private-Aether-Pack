added a few mods, Next update will be the move over to curseforge FULLY, this way the repo can be retired for the dedicated server storage we will have
~Next update will also include LootConfigs again, i think the mods was missing some addons needed to function quicker. so LootConfig will be added back
in v3.3.3

Also worked on minimal specs for the modpack, this will be listed on the CF Description

~This will be the "Medium" aka the Exploration & Adventure Pack, though the bigger pack will include guns (with real-like blockages and durability)
and much more terrain mods along with some custom EMC mappings and other QOL touch-ups that are needed
